In order to monitor our cluster, we will rely on Grafana and Prometheus.

The goal is to get from the router-pi3 the grafana runnning and displaying different KPIs of our cluster.

# Install Grafana

We will rely on this documentation:
https://grafana.com/tutorials/install-grafana-on-raspberry-pi/

After the installation, we enable the Grafana server. It is now accessible at http://<your ip>:3000
